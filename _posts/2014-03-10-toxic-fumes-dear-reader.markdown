I'm an advocate for DIY and hopefully this blog will become filled with triumphs over entropy and the service industry. But today's story is one of defeat.
While doing research on jailbreaking an iphone, I came across this <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaH10Scme_Q">body mod</a> where people were illuminating the Apple logo on the back of the iPhone 4. HOW COOLâ€½ Finally, some phone customization beyond over-priced body covers. While my 4's touchscreen recently shattered, I'd be willing to swap out the screen if I could get this to work. Now, that video is done using a $60 kit which comes with
<ul>
	<li>Necessary screwdrivers (slotted 2.0mm and TS1)</li>
	<li>A replacement back cover with a clear logo</li>
	<li>A professionally manufactured PCB with 6 surface mount LEDs</li>
	<li>2 different light diffusers</li>
</ul>

Not ready to invest $60 in this kit, I bought Radioshack's $20 mobile phone kit which includes the screwdrivers, 2 spudgers, tweezers, and a suction cup. About the same price you'd pay online with shipping. Plus, Radioshack has a student discount. I also got the smallest gauge wire they had. The last thing to get were the surface mount LEDS which had to be purchased online. Most of my components/tools come from <a href="www.jameco.com">Jameco</a> but they only sell them by the thousands, so I went to <a href="www.mouser.com">Mouser</a> and bought a hundred or so.
They're $0.012 - $0.03 a piece, why not?

I told myself I can be steady enough to not need the PCB, but do you know how small surface mount LEDs are?

But whatever, I wanted to get started.

7:00, the first two screws came out and the back cover slid right off. That's about all that went right. The iPhone 4's back cover isn't just a piece of black plastic with glass glued to it. Inside is a thin aluminum plate and it's why the mod kit is so necessary.

7:20, I started ripping up the metal with a Leatherman (not a prescribed tool) and much to my satisfaction, it tore like butter. The next task was to remove the apple shaped, mirrored finish. If you think I was able to precisely cut out the shape of the apple with a razor blade and etch it all away, you're giving me too much credit. Soon it was just a 2" diameter scratched up circle that I might be able to fix up with some masking tape, a sharpie, and optimism.
At this point the project was well beyond scrapped but I persisted to expose the leads and start soldering.

8:30, I had one LED with a + and - lead. Before going further I checked to see if the Vcc and GND pins described in the video would even work. They didn't. Nor would the phone even power on. (I left out the part where I tried to pry out the battery way earlier).

Failure.

Because of the jagged edges from the aluminum plate, the back cover wouldn't slide back on so I hammered it into place on hard surface. That did the trick and also punctured the battery. Immediately, my apartment was filled with an almost sweet but obviously very harmful odor. It kind of resembled strawberries. The phone also got very hot and alarming.
It was an appropriate conclusion and enough to make me regret ever being excited about the project.
But because I'm writing this 2 weeks later, I can assure you that I get over it and have started many more impulsive projects since then. More on those later with better pictures/documentation!
