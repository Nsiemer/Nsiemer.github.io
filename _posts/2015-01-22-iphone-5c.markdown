title: iPhone 5c Repair Gone Right

Remember my <a href="http://nsiemer.github.io//2014/03/29/cmoy-amp.html" target="_blank">CMOY pocket amplifier</a>? Embarrassingly, I somehow forgot to mention that I blew the headphone jack in my iPhone 5c with a prototype on a bread board that night. It was a humbling moment when I let some voltage go into the jack and turn the phone's screen to static. By some crazy electrical engineering miracle it rebooted itself seconds later and I went on with my life pretending nothing ever happened. Turns out that having a headphone jack in a phone isn't a life necessity but rather an opportunity to go buy a pink iPod nano.

Seven months later, the Lightning port on the phone stopped detecting when a cord was plugged in. The headphone jack happens to be a part of the same piece of hardware so I could get two birds stoned at once. <a href="http://www.ifixit.com" target="_blink">ifixit.com</a> is a great resource for this kind of project. They have all the hardware and tools available and a ton of How-To videos. I figured while I was at it, I'd go ahead and change out the battery, too.

So they sent me this

The piece on the left is the battery, the Lightning port is on the right, and that blue thing in the box is the adhesive that secures the battery to the back of the phone.

So to start, I unfastened the 2 screws by the Lightning port and cracked it open with two suction cups

From here I just followed along with the tutorial, slowly disconnecting components, mostly in a top-to-bottom fashion. Disconnecting the battery is a little tricky. The How-To I was using instructed me to pull the adhesive strips around the side of the battery and to not let them tear.
Well I let one tear so I lightly heated up the back with a hair dryer and was able to softly pry up the battery cell with a credit card. Be careful if you ever find yourself doing this. The cells are very fragile and no bueno when they puncture (as discovered in my <a href="http://nsiemer.github.io/2014/03/10/iphone-4-mod-gone-wrong.html" target="_blank">first post</a>).

Once I removed the battery, I got too into what I was doing to stop and keep taking pictures every step of the way. It all went according to plan and the Lightning port assembly really swapped right out. Everything was smooth sailing until I got it back together and powered it on. It took a concerning amount of time to boot up. And once it did, the screen had a bunch of vertical lines going down it, it wasn't finding a network, the home button had no effect and the screen wasn't responding to touch.

This grocery list seemed suspiciously long for me to have broken that many things. I'm no pro, but I'm not ENTIRELY incompetent. Just mostly incompetent, as the problem was being caused by the 3 pads of the touch screen not being connected properly. It's worth mentioning that if you ever mess with these things that they're also fragile and much harder to repair.

It wasn't until the 3rd try of reconnecting the pads that it happily booted up and was my phone again. The Lightning port is like new! The headphone jack lets sound out of it now but still has kind of a static sound going on. My best bet is that the backward charge made it further upstream and damaged the logic board. I guess I'll keep rockin' the pink nano.
