title:  "Pirate Chest"

This was the Tokyo Maker Faire. While I've never been to Tokyo, this video reaffirms all of my standing ideas of Tokyo. <br>

After the video, YouTube suggested other MAKE content. Specifically, this video of craftsman, Jimmy Diresta, making a pirate chest.<br>

Pretty neat, huh?
I couldn't stop watching Diresta's videos until I'd seen them all. They're motivating, yet paradoxically hypnotizing. The next morning, I was ready to trade in my phone for a hammer, grow a coat of chest hair, and go build a cabin in the woods.

Usually the most crushing obstacle to my projects is not having the proper tools. Magnificently fortunate for me, I'd been working in a fully outfitted industrial shop that had everything I needed for the pirate chest build!

To start, I went to Menards and got
<ul>
<li>36" x 48" sheet of 16 gauge steel (Diresta used 14 gauge)</li>
<li>48" x 1/4" round steel</li>
<li>48" of piano hinge.</li>
</ul>
This was all about $50.

I don't know what size his box was but I thought 16" wide, 11" tall, and 9" deep seemed like a nice size while "space framing" with a tape measure ...I don't have very exact methods all of the time.

My first deviation from Diresta's video happened when I couldn't find a sheet metal cutter. The 3/4" blade on a bandsaw did just fine.

<br>
From here, I scored each leaf with a 4" grinder and bent 90Â° using a piece of iron as a... thingy.<br><br>

<br>
Initially I ground down the welds to be somewhat clean. As I progressed, I decided that it wasn't very conducive to a rustic look so I threw some more messy welds back on it for asthetics.
<br>
Next was the lid.<br>

<br>

And then this really terrifying bit of plasma cutting. I'd never used one before so I played it safe along the edges and settled with doing a ton of grinding.

The handles were made of scrap shaft stock I found<br>

One last bit of fabrication before adding the finish was this "skirt" thing. When I welded the hinge on to the lid and box, the lid didn't quite make a good seal. This skirt effectively covered the gap and gave the chest a more brawny look by letting me put a ton more welds on the surface.

<h2>The Finish</h2><h4> This is important</h4>
Regarding the finish, Diresta painted this stuff on his pirate chest that magically turned it black. I'd never seen that before so it took a bit of uninformed googling to learn that it was likely a steel blackening oxidizing acid. I found some from this company called <a href="http://www.caswellplating.com" target="blank">Caswell</a>. It was about $20. For those keeping track, that's ~$70 so far.<br>

The thing about this stuff I got, is that it's a concentrate meant to make a bath, not to be brushed on. The stuff Diresta used was a gel, that Caswell also sells, I just didn't know that I'd need it. So use the gel!
Also, clean the surface off very well with a wire brush and steel wool.<br>
<h3>See?</h3><br>

So I found a cooler that could fit more than half of the frame in it and filled it with a mixture of distilled water and defluoridized infant water (it was either distilled or underwent reverse osmosis).<br>

Again, use the gel. I got a lot of solution on my hands and arms. No irritation came of it, but probably not very healthy.<br>
<h4>The result</h4><br><img src="http://nsiemer.github.io/media/IMG_3907.JPG" width="250" height="333"><br>

<h4>The end game</h4>
All that was left was to put some wood in. Diresta smoothly ran a circular saw down a shipping pallet. The pallets I had access to were a bit more wonky and required some more picking and choosing. But if I make another one, I won't use pallet wood. It stinks. <br>

<h3>And boom!</h3><br>

I didn't cover it well, but that 1/4" round steel from Menards was used on the latch. I heated it up with a blow torch and just bent it into 2 U shapes.

All in all, it was about 22 hours of work and somewhere between $70 and $90 of materials considering the distilled water and welding wire.
