Check it: I found this awesome new service called <a href="http://www.spritzinc.com" target="_blank">Spritz</a> on <a href="http://www.iflscience.com" target="_blank">I Fucking Love Science</a>.
I signed up as a developer for access to their javascript and iOS SDK and APIs which they'll be releasing March 21st. I plan to implement it on this blog as soon as possible.

Pretty neat, huh? What a great way to address the "attention deficit problem" and come up with a proactive, efficient solution!

Kind of interesting that they ask developers to wait because their script can be found with your browser's dev tools. What's holding me back is that I have a bio test in the morning and I've spent the last couple hours reading these:

	</ul>

I also found <a href="http://www.spritzinc.com/author/sudo/" target="_blank">this</a>.
Perhaps indicating that they'll first support WordPress?
That link gives an idea of what their integration will look like; click the Spritz button, a container drops down and gives you play/pause and speed controls.
