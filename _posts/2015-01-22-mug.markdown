This project was something that came to me while making the pirate chest. I was really enjoying the mix of wood and metal and wanted to do more. My research turned up some neat projects but nothing was close to what I wanted so I made up my own design.

I went to Menards and got 22 gauge steel<br>

<br>
I bought enough material to make 15 of these bad boys.
They got cut down to 3/4" strips. Look kinda dangerous, huh?

<br>
The bench grinder cleaned 'em up well enough.

<br>
At this point I knew that the mug would be 6" tall, 5" wide, and that the wood would be 1/2" thick. But no idea about the handle. Or how I'd even attach it to the mug. For this reason I made a mock up out of a manila folder. It took me right back to architecture class.

During the mock-up, I decided that I wanted 1" gaps between the bands and the top/bottom of mug. This left me w/ 4" or less to get the handle attached. In the model you can see that my fingers fit comfortably around the handle and that it gets kind of skinny near the top band. When it came down to cutting out the handle, I wasn't sure it would be strong enough to live through being thunderously slammed down so I beefed it up and can now only fit 3 fingers through the handle.

Each side of the mug is a 1/2" tall, 2" wide, 6" long trapezoid with 22.5Â° sides. All cut on a table saw.
I wasn't worried about the sides of the mug being water tight, but definitely the bottom. Rather than doing a traditional dado and wrapping the sides around the base, I cut 1/2 lap joints on the table saw and cleaned them up with a chisel.

<br>
To form the vessel, I laid out an 18" strip of tape, face up. Then aligning the side pieces not by the top or bottom, but by making sure the half-joint cuts were all adjacent. With them all laying on the tape I poured glue into the valleys between them, then pulled the tape together into an octagon.
A good ol' tourniquet did exactly the same job as a $20 round clamp.

Making the handle was frustrating on a 3/4" bandsaw blade. I tried bringing a chisel into the mix.

<br>
It was a dumb idea.

<br>
I didn't finish the handle till a week later, outside of the shop, with a coping saw and just sanding forever.

<br>

The channels for the steel bands were originally cut by a 2" die grinder in the shop but I didn't get them as deep as I wanted so I used the chisels again. It'd been a while since I'd used chisels and I forgot to first chisel in boundaries for the channels. a few wood bits broke of around the edges as a result. Live & learn.

<br>

So we're at the end game. I wrapped and clamped the steel bands around their channels on the mug while tapping them with a hammer so they'd learn their shape around the corners. I attached the bands to the handle by drilling a pilot hole through both, hammering a wire brad halfway into the handle, sawing off the excess brad, leaving about a 1/4" to be hammered down, securing the steel to the wood. On the next ones I make, I'll heat the steel up in the oven before finding their anchor points on the handle for a tighter binding to the mug.
