title: Social Network Names
---

On this terrible social media app for college students, you can get the tagging name of every / any user you want with

<ul> iExplorer (free)</ul>
<ul> sqlbrowser (free)</ul>
<ul> Microsoft Excel</ul>
<ul> an email address</ul>


Start by plugging in your iphone and opening iExplorer.
go to Apps > (appName) > Library > Application Support > (appName)2 > and copy the Erodr.sqlite file onto your HDD.<br>
I just put it on my desktop.

Now open sqlbrowser from <a href="https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser" target="_blank">HERE</a>.
Import the erodr.sqlite database and open the ZUSER table and export it as .csv
Open the .csv file in Excel, filter / sort it however you want (by sex, by people who have >10,000 likes, etc.) Now copy the columns of the names you want into a new spread sheet. First names in the first column, last names in the second column. Save the new spreadsheet as a .xls file.
Now copy and paste this code into a text editor and save it as `names.rb`
to your desktop.

Press the Command key + space bar <br>
Type "Terminal" <br>
press enter <br>
in the terminal, type `cd ~/desktop` <br>
press enter <br>
in the terminal, type `ruby names.rb` <br>
press enter <br>

A new .txt file should've appeared on your desktop labelled "generatedNames.txt"
Open it. Copy the contents in an email to yourself. Open the email on your phone and Bob's your uncle.
