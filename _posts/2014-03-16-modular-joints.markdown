Here's a fun, Project Euler-esque brain exercise:<br>
You're given bars of 28" X 1" X 1" square iron.
Each bar has on one end, a 1/4" bracket at the first quarter inch, and at the other end, a 1/4" bracket at the third quarter inch. Let's call these the 1 and 3 ends, respectively. The bars can be flipped over, creating ends 2 and 4.
<br>
By flipping and rotating these bars, build a 4X4 modular grid where each bracket is adjacent to another bracket. For example, a 2 can be connected to a 1 or 3. But 3 must be present before it can connect to a 4. A 4 can only connect to a 3.
