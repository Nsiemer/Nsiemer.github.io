I was looking through some of the <a href="http://www.ruby-doc.org" target="_blank">Ruby Core API</a> to sharpen the saw and maybe finally figure out symbols. So I wrote up this silly script.
<div class="local">
<script src="https://gist.github.com/Nsiemer/9551804.js" target="_blank"></script>
</div>
Any ideas? I'm working on implementing a comments section <a href="https://github.com/mpalmer/jekyll-static-comments#readme">github.com/mpalmer/jekyll-static-comments</a> for times like this. But for now, I think my one reader knows how to reach me.
<div class="revision">
*Revision: My ruby code was originally highlighted by a call to Jekyll but it looked terrible and embedding Gists seem way better. Version control, comments, raw text option, and simply having more activity on <a href="https://github.com/ target="_blank"">Github</a>.
</div>
Only hours later I received a pretty, elegant solution.
<div class="external">
  <script src="https://gist.github.com/maxjacobson/3706d9605edb8773a2c8.js">
  </script>
    <div class="cite">
    <h4>Max Jacobson</h4>
