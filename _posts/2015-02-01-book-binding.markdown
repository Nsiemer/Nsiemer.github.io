Here's Jimmy DiResta making a journal:<br>

See how he has each piece of paper folded individually? I imagine this method has a lot of pros but on further research I found other tutorials where they'd fold ~5 sheets of paper at a time into packets called, "Signatures." The signatures get sewn together along the spine, with ribbon beneath the stitches. The ribbon will eventually be what holds the pages into the covers. Because I didn't have any super cloth (the gauze stuff DiResta glued on the spine) or know where to get it offline, I opted for doing the sewn signatures method.
Here's the video I used for reference doing the signatures:<br>

The materials:
<li>
  <ul>Paper of your choosing. I used 50 sheets of drawing paper.</ul></li>
<li>
  <ul>PVA (Poly-Vinyl Acetate) glue. Or plain white Elmer's glue. There are also <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0025TZ26Q/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1" target="_blank">specialty glues</a> available for book binding</ul>
<li>
  <ul>Plain 2" craft ribbon</ul>
</li><li>
  <ul>1mm waxed cotton thread (There are also specialty bookbinding threads.)</ul>
</li><li>
  <ul>Rigid poster or cardboard stock of your choosing for the covers.</ul>
</li><li>
  <ul>Vinyl for the cover</ul>
</li><li>
  <ul>"Craft needles" or an awl needle with an eye.</ul>
</li><li>
  <ul>Card stock for the insides of the covers to seal down the ribbon to the cardboards. DiResta used pages from a gun magazine in his video for this.</ul>
</li><li>
  <ul><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007LS8G0/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1" target="_blank">Super Cloth</a></ul>

Unlike the 2nd video I embedded, I used a 6-hole template rather than 4-hole so I could use 2 ribbons. Possibly unnecessary.

Sewing together the signatures is the most painstaking part of the craft. It's important that the signatures are sewn tightly so they won't wiggle after the book is bound.

On my first book I didn't clamp the edges of the signatures before clamping the folds which led to one of the signatures falling out of place on the spine when. Don't skip that step. I did bind the edges on my 2nd book before clamping the spine but they still came out a little lop-sided. I suppose the best solution is to make sure you use pieces of wood that can cover all of the pages' surface area.

Then plenty of glue on the spine. Just make sure it doesn't drip down the edges. I don't know what those threaded tabs of paper that DiResta used are called. Thus I didn't use them. I made a second book for a friend and glued in a green ribbon as a bookmark.

While the spine dried, I made the covers just as DiResta did. I got a little more elaborate on the second book.

On mine, I used a heavy black vinyl for the cover. Because of the material's thickness, it took a while to stretch and wear into the negative space of my name. The second book had finer lettering so I used a thinner, more expensive material.

Gluing the signatures into the cover is a little tricky. If you don't get the spine snugged to the spine cover all of the pages will wiggle in the cover. I wasn't very cautious of this on my first book and I imagine the movement will one day wear out the glue's bond.

When making something for someone else, presentation can go a long way.
