title:  "CMOY Amplifier"
---
I've invested far too much in components and tools to have not made a pocket amplifier so that started happening around 9pm last night. The design is centered around an LM386N IC chip from Radioshack. These are often called CMoy amps after Chu Moy who is credited for designing this schematic.

This would be the appropriate time to declare that I am sloppy at circuitry and have never taken a circuit theory class. The bulk of my knowledge comes from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOJuCYgmPPE&list=PLDE23FAC8A681FA46" target="_blank"> Collin's Lab by MAKE</a> on YouTube.
<h3>So I used this schematic</h3>

And included the bass boost from pin 5 to 1 on the amp.

<h3>Here's my prototype on a breadboard</h3>

Typically this pocket amp is housed in an Altoids tin but I didn't have one around because gross. After several laps around my apartment all I could come up with for an enclosure was an empty deoderant stick.

This project only has a few space limitations <ol>
<li>The potentiometer</li>
<li>Battery</li>
<li>Perfboard with several capacitors</li>
<li>Headphone jacks and swithes</li></ol>
<h3>So I started with the fun part: jacks and switches</h3>
<div class="container">

</div>
One switch powers on the amp while the other selects the output, 3.5mm or 6.3mm.
The input comes from a 3.5mm cable hanging out of the bottom of the body.

Next was the potentiometer/volume control.
Being in a deoderant stick, I couldn't not have the dial be the pot.

<h3>Inside of the body</h3>

The perfboard need a bit trimmed off the top. Scissors worked just fine.

I didn't take any pictures during the soldering just so I could get it over with. The sloppiness of it isn't anything to brag about anyway.<br>

<h3>But here's the final product</h3>

Bonus! At the earlier mentioned <a href="http://www.hackaweek.com" target="_blank">Hackaweek.com</a> page, he went into looking at sine waves on an oscilloscope a bit. A couple of months ago, I bought an oscilloscope of my own on <a href="http://www.ebay.com" target="_blank">Ebay</a> for $35. It's a 10MHz GW GOS-3310 and obviously not a very good oscope (useful ones sell between $900-$4000). But up until yesterday I didn't even think it worked. All I could get it to do was make a flat green line on the screen. But when I saw the hackaweek dude hook it up to the headphone output of a laptop, I checked the app store to see if they had any sine wave generating apps, and they do!

It was pretty neat.
