Hello, World! My name is Nick. I'm majoring in biology and minoring in architecture at Mizzou. Those subjects are like peas 'n carrots, right? I'm also autodidactically learning to code which most of the content on here will be about. I made a friend on Twitter -gosh- a couple of years ago through mutual admiration of user @carla_bare. He introduced me to the language Ruby and I finally got going with it around November of 2012. I started off with Zed Shaw's <a href="http://ruby.learncodethehardway.org/book/">Learn Ruby the Hard Way</a> book, then developing my chops at <a href="projecteuler.net">Project Euler</a>. Project Euler is really cool site where you're challenged to solve problems that are infeasible to solve with pencil and paper. Questions like <highlight>If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.</highlight>
{% highlight ruby %}
z = (0...1000).find_all{|item| item % 3 == 0 or item % 5 == 0}.inject(0){|sum, item| sum + item}
puts "The answer is #{z}.
{% endhighlight %}
